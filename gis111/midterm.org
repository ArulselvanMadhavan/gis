*GEOG 111: Midterm Exam*

*Answer each of the following questions. No answer need be longer than
2-3 sentences. Type your answers and then upload them to Canvas by
Wednesday, October 21^{st}. The test is open book and open note.*

*Map Projections, Datum, and GCS*

1. Compare and contrast the types of distortions between conformal and
   equal-area projections when in areas outside their respective
   low-distortion zones.

   Conformal - preserves shapes distorts angle, area, size, distance,
   or scale
   Equal area - preserves area and distorts angle, shape, distance, scale

2. What tools will change projection visually but not make changes to
   data files? What tools will change projection in data files?

   Project - Allows you to change projection without updating data
   files
   Define Projection - Changes projection in the data files

3. What do the zone numbers of UTM projections represent?

   UTM projections divide 360 degrees into 60 zones of 6 degrees width
   in longitude. The zones are numbered increasingly from 180W to
   174E. So, Zone 10 would mean 180W - (6 * 10) = 120W to 126W

4. I have streets from one data source, and streams from another data
   source, covering the same area. They appear very far away from each
   other in ArcMap. What do I have to do to make them overlay?

   Use "Batch Project" to change the coordinate system of the two
   feature classes to a common coordinate system.

5. Why is it easier to represent smaller areas accurately in any map
   projection?

   Positional accuracy, Logical accuracy, conceptual accuracy,
   attribute accuracy - As areas increase, the number of overlaps the
   projections has to handle and demarcate increases. Projections also
   has to carry the resolution of the data to the calculations and
   round them off within the accepted "uncertainty accuracy %".

*Databases*

6.  I have two tables: landlords table and buildings belonging to the
    landlords. Each building is wholly owned by one landlord. What is
    the cardinality of the relationship (1-1, 1-M, M-N)?

    1-1

7.  If I join the buildings and landlords table together to show the
    residence address of building owners, which table is the base table?

    landlords table

8.  Table A can be decomposed into two related tables, at least one of
    which has fewer rows than table A. Is table A normalized or
    de-normalized?

    De-normalized

9.  What are the benefits of a normalized table structure? What are the
    benefits of a de-normalized table structure?

    Denormalized table - data can be queried quickly. Useful for cases
   data is mostly read but not written to or combined with (using joins)

    Normalized table - reduces data redundancy, and thereby allowing
   easier combinations with other tables. Less room for inconsistency
   or collisions. Highly focussed

10. How do I extract the first 4 characters of a text field's value (the
    field's name is “USER_NAME”)?

    In SQL
    #+BEGIN_SRC sql
    select SUBSTRING(USER_NAME, 1, 4) as SHORT_UN
    #+END_SRC
    For labels:
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
   def FindLabel ( [table.USER_NAME]):
     sd = [table.USER_NAME]
   return sd[0:4]
    #+END_SRC

*Spatial Analysis*

11. Briefly define suitability analysis.

    Suitability analysis is the evaluation of an area for a particular
    use. For example, when importing data that is not GIS tagged or
    marked with co-ordinates, as in the case of an image, we choose a
    known coordinate in the map and try to align the image to that
    point. Suitability analysis is that each aspect of the landscape
    has intrinsic characteristics that are either suitable or
    unsuitable for the activities being planned 

12. I am doing an overlay analysis (“union”) of two GIS layers: a forest
    polygon layer and air pollution layer. The forest polygons comprise
    6 different forest types. The air pollution layer has 4 categories
    from low to high. Will the output layer have more or less polygons
    than either input layers? What is the maximum number of unique
    categories in the output data?
    
    More polygons. Maximum = 6 + 4(If none overlap)

13. I'm performing a union operation using a pollution layer and a
    census tract layer. The two layers have different extents. What will
    be the value of “pollution level” field in areas outside the extents
    of the pollution layer?

    The value of "pollution_level" from census tract layer will take
    precedence, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, it will be NULL

14. What is a multi-part feature? What are the benefits of using
    multi-part features?

    Multi-part feature is when you represent a feature using multiple
    physical parts(line or polygon). The benefits are that you can
    represent a group of disparate but connected features without
    having to separate them for display purposes, since they are
    logically connected. Example: A group of islands(Archipalego) that
    share the same feature table but are physically separated.
