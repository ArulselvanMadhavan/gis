*** Questions
   1. Is the ratio similar for both city pairs? Explain the reason using
   characteristics of conformal projections.

   |             | Distance Ratio                      |
   |-------------+-------------------------------------|
   | SF-Oakland  | 13468.69223/13427.114736 = 1.00309  |
   | SF-South SF | 13393.025585/13353.053029 = 1.00299 |
   
   Ratio does look similar.
   

   - Calculate the distance ratio for projection 4 vs. projection 3.
     Is the ratio similar for both city pairs? Explain the reason
     using characteristics of equal area projections.
     |             | Distance Ratio                      |
     |-------------+-------------------------------------|
     | SF-Oakland  | 14741.014902/13313.129201 = 1.10725 |
     | SF-South SF | 12090.4947/13483.218558 = 0.89670   |
     
     Ratio is not similar. Reason: 
   - Did the bearing values change between projection 1 and projection
     2? Explain the reason using characteristics of conformal
     projections.

     Bearing value changed very little (approx ~0.004). 

   - Did the bearing values change between projection 3 and projection
     4? Explain the reason using characteristics of equal area
     projections.
     
     Bearing values did change, especially noticeable between SF and Oakland
     projections(magnitude of 3). Reason:

*** Questions
    1. Ratio of area projection 2/projection 1
       Muir woods - 493.822755/490.632498 = 1.00656
       Ratio is almost equal to 1 between two projections which was
       the case in section 1 when distance between two cities were compared
    2. Ratio of area projection 2/projection 1
       Joshua tree - 735225.583707/738338.037075 = 0.99578
       Ratio is almost equal to 1 between two projections which was
       the case in section 1 when distance between two cities were compared
    3. Ratio of projection 3 vs projection 4
       Muir woods - 490.698786 / 490.696565 = 1.00000
       Joshua tree - 735213.550687 / 735212.090587 = 1.00000

*** Questions
    1. Is the ratio similar for both city pairs? Explain the reason
       using characteristics of conformal projections.

       SF-South SF Distance Ratio: Proj2/Proj1 : 1.00183
    2. Did the bearing values change between projection 1 and
       projection 2? Explain the reason using characteristics of
       conformal projections.
